# Profile and Magazine Project

This project is about creating a personal profile to fill in information about yourself as a mini biography of yourself and also add a magazine about it, it could be your favorite day or weather and expand on that.

The idea is to implement HTML/CSS with the Bootstrap framework and not necessarily use UX/UI but make the project as creative as possible. I used Git to create the repository and github to store my progress alike.

I'm focusing on working on my github with the details of the progress so I can have a clear handle on everything it covers.

The truth is that the goal is to make it as presentable and aesthetic as possible, it would be my greatest achievement.
